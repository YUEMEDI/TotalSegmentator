# TotalSegmentator Custom Tools & Extensions

This repository contains custom tools and extensions developed for TotalSegmentator to enhance 3D visualization, web export, and remote deployment capabilities.

## 🎯 Overview

These tools were developed to solve common issues with medical imaging visualization and create professional web-based 3D viewers for TotalSegmentator results.

## 📁 Custom Tools

### **3D Visualization & Export**
- **`export_to_web3d.py`** - Convert NIfTI segmentations to STL/OBJ with Three.js web viewer
- **`simple_web3d_viewer.py`** - Generate standalone 3D web viewers
- **`serve_web3d.py`** - Local HTTP server for CORS-free 3D viewing

### **3D Slicer Compatibility**
- **`combine_masks_for_slicer.py`** - Combine binary masks into multi-label volumes
- **`fix_nifti_for_slicer.py`** - Fix NIfTI header issues for 3D Slicer compatibility

### **Web Viewer**
- **`simple_viewer.py`** - Basic HTML viewer for segmentation results

### **Remote Deployment**
- **`deploy-remote-access.ps1`** - Complete remote access setup for Windows
- **`setup-ssl-certificates.ps1`** - SSL certificate management
- **`nginx-reverse-proxy.conf`** - Nginx configuration for secure access
- **`cloudflare-tunnel-config.yml`** - Cloudflare tunnel configuration

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **Convert Segmentations to 3D Web Viewer**
```bash
# 1. Export NIfTI to STL/OBJ
python export_to_web3d.py

# 2. Create web viewer
python simple_web3d_viewer.py

# 3. Serve with local server (solves CORS issues)
python serve_web3d.py
```

### **3D Slicer Compatibility**
```bash
# Fix NIfTI files for 3D Slicer
python fix_nifti_for_slicer.py

# Combine multiple masks
python combine_masks_for_slicer.py
```

### **Remote Access Setup (Windows)**
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
.\deploy-remote-access.ps1 -Domain "totalseg.yourdomain.com" -Method "cloudflare"
```

## 📋 Requirements

### **Python Dependencies**
```bash
pip install nibabel scikit-image trimesh numpy scipy
```

### **For Web Viewing**
- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Local HTTP server (included in serve_web3d.py)

### **For Remote Access**
- Windows 10/11 with PowerShell
- Docker Desktop (for containerized deployment)
- Domain name (for SSL certificates)

## 🏗️ Architecture Options

### **Option 1: Local Development**
```
NIfTI files → Python scripts → 3D web viewer → Local browser
```

### **Option 2: Remote Server**
```
Internet → Nginx/Cloudflare → TotalSegmentator Web App → GPU Processing
```

### **Option 3: Raspberry Pi Orchestrator**
```
Pi 4 (Load Balancer) → Multiple GPU Servers → Shared Storage (QNAP)
```
